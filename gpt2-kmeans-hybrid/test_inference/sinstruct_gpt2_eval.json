With the OneLove band we express this message,” said Virgil van Dijk, the Netherlands captain.\n“On behalf of the Dutch team I have been wearing this band for quite a while now. It is good to see that other countries are joining this initiative.”\nOneLove was founded in the Netherlands in 2020 to emphasize that all football fans have at least one thing in common – their love of football – and to speak out against any form of discrimination.\nAs well as focusing on public messaging, the initiative has also developed to offer diversity training to grassroots club.\n“Our love of football unites us all. No matter where you come from, what you look like and who you love. Football is there for everyone and our sport must stand up for the people across the world who face discrimination and exclusion,” said Germany captain Manuel Neuer.\n“I am proud to be sending out this message with my colleagues from the other national teams. Every single voice counts.”\nIn June, England’s captain Harry Kane revealed that he had discussed taking a collective stance regarding human rights in Qatar with Denmark’s Christian Eriksen and France captain Hugo Lloris.\n“I am honored to join my fellow national team captains in supporting the important OneLove campaign,” he said on Tuesday.\n“As captains we may all be competing against each other on the pitch, but we stand together against all forms of discrimination. This is even more relevant at a time when division is common in society. Wearing the armband together on behalf of our teams will send a clear message when the world is watching.”"

Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?!

Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",

Non-governmental organizations also play a role in promoting fair trade standards by serving as independent monitors of compliance with labeling requirements. As such, it is a form of Protectionism."

This section should not take you an entire week.\n- Installing and Using Python\nIn this module you will set things up so you can write Python programs. Not all activities in this module are required for this class so please read the \"Using Python in this Class\" material for details.\n- Chapter One: Why We Program (continued)\nIn the first chapter we try to cover the \"big picture\" of programming so you get a \"table of contents\" of the rest of the book. Don't worry if not everything makes perfect sense the first time you hear it. This chapter is quite broad and you would benefit from reading the chapter in the book in addition to watching the lectures to help it all sink in. You might want to come back and re-watch these lectures after you have funished a few more chapters.\n- Chapter Two: Variables and Expressions\nIn this chapter we cover how a program uses the computer's memory to store, retrieve and calculate information.\n- Chapter Three: Conditional Code\nIn this section we move from sequential code that simply runs one line of code after another to conditional code where some steps are skipped. It is a very simple concept - but it is how computer software makes \"choices\".\n- Chapter Four: Functions\nThis is a relatively short chapter. We will learn about what functions are and how we can use them. The programs in the first chapters of the book are not large enough to require us to develop functions, but as the book moves into more and more complex programs, functions will be an essential way for us to make sense of our code.\n- Chapter Five: Loops and Iteration\nLoops and iteration complete our four basic programming patterns. Loops are the way we tell Python to do something over and over. Loops are the way we build programs that stay with a problem until the problem is solved."

It's mainly made from recycled parts.\nWhen a 1.5 volt battery is new it will probably have more than 1.5 volts in it. As the battery is used the voltage will decrease until the voltage is not enough to run the application ( E.g. a red LED) and will be called 'dead' . But a Dead battery still has some power remaining in it - just not enough voltage. The trick is to use some of that remaining power to increase the voltage in a circuit. The trade off being there will be a reduction in current.\nHere is the required steps:\n1- Connect a switch to a battery holder. A soldiering iron and hot glue gun assisted with this.\n2- Make a small pyramid above the battery holder using 4 bamboo skewer sticks secured with hot glue.\n3- Soldier on a 1.8 volt red LED at the top of the mini Christmas tree.\n4- Test the LED glows with a new battery (1.6 volts)\n5- Test the LED doesn't glow with a dead battery (1.2 volts)\n6- Add in the buzzer circuit, along with a switch.\n7- Add in the windings circuit - to touch the striker of the buzzer a little copper foil was added.\n8- Insert a dead battery (1.2 volt) with the buzzer circuit turned switch off - the LED will not glow but when the buzzer circuit is switched on the Red LED lights up."

It also needs to rotate on itself. Bend up the outer tab into a L shape using some pilers and then bend it forward so a piece of string can hang from it over the center of the can. This will allow the can to rotate on itself. Close the pouring opening by using a knife or other thin object, bending the opening back up so it almost where it was before the beverage can was opened.\nStep 2: Nozzel Jets\nMake a couple of holes in the side of the can, about half way up, opposite each other using a small drill. The diameter of the holes should be about the same as the thin plastic tubing to be used as jet nozzles. Enlarge the holes so they are elliptical allowing the nozzle tubes to lie parallel against the cans side.\nStep 3: Making a Pressure Vessel\nSeal the top of the opened can using super glue and baking soda to make a small pressure vessel. Add some super glue to the closed opening and then sprinkle on some baking soda - they will combine to make a plastic. Keep adding super glue and baking soda until the top is sealed.\nStep 4: Attaching the Nozzle Jets\nFit in the thin plastic tubes to the holes drilled in the sides of the can and seal with super glue and baking soda. Try to have the tubes pointing horizontal in the direction you want to rotate the can when the steam exits the nozzles.\nStep 5: Creating Steam\nAdd a little water into the can though one of the nozzles. Just add maybe a teaspoon or so. \nStep 6: In Action\nThe can was suspended from a tripod over the methylated sprits flame. After a couple of minutes enough steam had built up to rotate the can."

        "output": "The green light symbolizes several different things to different characters throughout the book, but overall, it stands for the inaccessibility of the American Dream. At the start of the novel, the light symbolizes Gatsby's unwavering love for Daisy. He stands at the end of the dock gazing across the bay, reaching for the light, waiting for Daisy to come back to him. His hope, like the eternal green light, is unfaltering. It isn't until Daisy admits later that she had never really noticed the light that the facade began to slip. Nick, the narrator, starts to recognize it as a symbol of Gatsby's unhealthy desperation rather than his love. This is parallel to Gatsby's experience of the American Dream and money. Gatsby is unbelievably rich at the beginning of the novel. This solidifies his belief in the American Dream, though he still reaches for the acceptance of those who are wealthier and more popular. Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it. As the story unfolds and the mystery and mystique around Gatsby fade, so does Gatsby and Nick's blind belief and trust in the American Dream. After Gatsby is murdered, the green light is symbolic of the ways that money and affluence ruin the lives of those without. It is also symbolic of the way that the American dream ruins the lives of those eternally reaching for it."

If we look more closely, we see that once we satisfy the second inequality, the first is redundant.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\nExplain: The dominant sequence transduction models",

We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set.

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",
